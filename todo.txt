first todo (where I stopped)
===============
- was adding searchMethod() for forEachStatements in LoopsFilter

rest todo
=========
- design loopFilter to filter through forEach, for, lambda, iterator, listIterator and while loops etc. (and depends on how exhaustive the user wants it)
- migrate sourceParser to Preprocessor slowly, eventually renaming PreProcessor to SourceParser.
- add dependencyLineFilter that converts the zeros to full blown dependency lines without spaces
- add fileNameFilter that cleans the filePath, set the file name, determine if its exist once and for-all (add isAccessible var to jClass). Should be first Filter to run.
- write module for fixig dsm -> to rewrite java class paths to package level and include list of source locations. 
- move the buildClasses functionality from browser to Preprocessor.
- Convert the entire system into a Pipe and filter.
- Implement A -> B; B -> C :- A -> C for layered abstraction.
