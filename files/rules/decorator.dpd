Their Differences are in intent, not structure:
The intent of Decorator is to decorate a single component (the UML diagram really should show a multiplicity of one for the decorated component),
whereas the intent of Composite is to group Components as a whole in the Composite (again, the UML should show a Composite containing one or more Components).
Decorator has a goal to add behavior (enhance behavior of the Operation() method) via the ConcreteDecorators, whereas Composite aims to collect Components
