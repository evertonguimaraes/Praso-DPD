USE:
====
A class Foo USE another class Bar when one of its member fields or variables need Bar to be instanciated.
A common/typical example is Map<String, Bar> barDicts = new Map(); in Foo.java
example 2:
RedissionTest.java uses Node.java because of the line below in RedissionTest.java in redisson project.
Iterator<Node> iter = nodes.getNodes().iterator();
