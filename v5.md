Path to Usefulness
------------------
- be able to get subdsm by running "subdsm(find("observer"))"
- be able to save dsm by running "export(dsm, 'test.dsm')"


Notes
-----
- The concept of Entities as holders of data would not hold here, it would require unzipping results from dsmDS.
- Using Entities would lead to buckets and soon we'll have another Java on our hands.
- Because we indeed do not need a Bucket - as the environment IS the bucket.
- Giving the goal to integrate a full-fledge abstracted REPL, users can tap into method calls and their results in real time
- Which would lend itself to composition of functions of existing Bucket and Entity classes
- Except a robust environment and categorization system would be necessary to breaking things up in the end

- `b <= e1 EXTEND e2` would become `assign(e1, e2, fill(e1, e2, dependency(EXTEND)))`
- or for short `=fill(e1*, e2*, dependency(EXTEND))`
- `fill(e1, e2, dependency(EXTEND))` returns a new collection tuple (e1, e2) by appending dependency result to e1 and e2
- detailed toString implementation would be necessary for intermediary results observation


Dev Plan
--------
- experiment with keyInterfaces and other dsms
- create an REPL
    1. using a simple interpreter in which case you define the language
        - fine grained control over execution, making exception etc
        - allow weird constructs
    2. using an already existing interpreter, in which case you only pre-process the input for syntactic sugars
        - users can add "their" own code to the execution pipeline easily
        - no need to "learn" a new language - just look at and use the functions exposed
        - easier to entend and less worry about handling edge cases introduced by weird constructs
        - offload the burden of an Interpreter
- expose all the functions users would need to REPL via common interface
