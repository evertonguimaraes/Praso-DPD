General improvements:
- make praso case sensitive
- move entity to a map instead of array
- Increase control over parsing to 1. improve error result and 2. allow stronger arg assertions
	

Making functions testable
	- Introduce BucketResult as the result of computing a BucketCondition
	- Limit the operations of bucket to the five operators and test thoroughly the bucket interface
	- Provide assertions in the code to help debugging
	- move all operator functions to a separate, publicly exposed testable interface that returns BucketResult
	- increase the power of the evaluator over the "correctness" of arguments to free up this new interface from unnecessary checks
